Hands-On: Dynamic Array Resizing
This activity is designed to reinforce your understanding of the dynamic array resizing strategy used to implement the ArrayBag class. You should study the instructional resources on the ArrayBag implementation before attempting this activity.

You will need the following source code files to complete this activity.

Bag.java
ArrayBag.java
ArrayIterator.java
ArrayBagClient.java

Note: This activity utilizes jGRASP Viewers, which are available in jGRASP, IntelliJ, and Eclipse.

Dynamic Resizing
Open ArrayBagClient.java, then compile and run it. Observe the output to understand what the main method is doing.

Use breakpoints, the debugger, and jGRASP viewers to observe the array being resized as elements are added to the ArrayBag object.

Modify the ArrayBagClient so that elements are both added and removed from the ArrayBag object. Then, use breakpoints, the debugger, and jGRASP viewers to observe the array being resized.

Continue to experiment with the ArrayBagClient until you are confident that you understand the array resizing behavior.

Submission
The submission page for this activity asks you to apply your understanding of dynamic array resizing to a problem and then submit it for a grade.
