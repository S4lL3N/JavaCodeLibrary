Hands-On: Collections
This activity is designed to illustrate the design and utility of elements of the Java Collections Framework (JCF). You should study the instructional resources on Collections before attempting this activity.

You will need the following source code files to complete this activity.

Song.java
Playlist.java

Note: This activity utilizes jGRASP Viewers, which are available in jGRASP, IntelliJ, and Eclipse.

Playlist
Open Playlist.java, then compile and run it. Observe the output to understand what the main method is doing.

Set a breakpoint on the following line in the main method: List<Song> playlist = new ArrayList<>();

Start the debugger and wait until execution is paused at the breakpoint.

Step over this statement and then raise a viewer on the playlist object.

Step over the next several statements and watch the viewer as it shows the effect of adding songs to the playlist.

Note that four different implementing classes of the List interface are already imported (ArrayList, LinkedList, Stack, and Vector). Systematically change the instantiation of playlist to each of these classes in turn. Run and debug the program each time to observe that the functionality of the program doesnâ€™t change although the exact nature of the playlist object does indeed change.

Working with collections
Practice working with collecitons by completing the runningTime method in the Playlist class. Note that your solution will work for any class that implements the List interface.
Submission
The submission page for this activity asks you to complete the runningTime method above and then submit it for a grade.
