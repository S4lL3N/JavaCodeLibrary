Hands-On: AVL Trees
This activity focuses on the fundamental mechanics of adding new values to an AVL tree. You should study the instructional resources on AVL trees implementation before
attempting this activity.

You will need the following source code files to complete this activity.

  AvlTree.java
  AvlTreeClient.java

Note: This activity utilizes jGRASP Viewers, which are available in jGRASP, IntelliJ, and Eclipse.

Adding values, self-check
  1.Open AvlTreeClient.java in jGRASP and compile it.
  2.Run this program, observe the output, and make sure you understand what it is doing.
  3.Set a breakpoint on the statement avl.add(value) in the main method.
  4.Start the debugger and wait until execution is paused at the breakpoint.
  5.Raise a viewer on the avl object. Use the viewer settings menu to customize the viewer as you like. For example, you may prefer to have the nodes rendered as circles, and you will most likely prefer that the root be at the top with descendants below.
  6.With pen and paper, add the current value to an AVL tree that you draw yourself.
  7.Step over the call to add to confirm your answer.
  8.Repeat this process for each element in the values array.
  9.Make sure you understand how to build an AVL tree from a given sequence of values.
  
Adding values
  1.Open AvlTreeClient.java in jGRASP and compile it.
  2.Run this program, observe the output, and make sure you understand what it is doing.
  3.Set a breakpoint on the statement avl.add(value) in the main method.
  4.Start the debugger and wait until execution is paused at the breakpoint.
  5.Open a new Canvas window.
  6.Add viewers for values, value, and avl to the canvas window.
  7.Step in to the call to add.
  8.Using step-over and step-in as needed, explore the execution of the add and put methods, observing their effect in the canvas window.
  9.Repeat this process for each element in the values array.
  10.Make sure you understand how the add and put methods work, especially the rebalancing operations that happen.
