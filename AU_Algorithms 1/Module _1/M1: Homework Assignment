Late Assignment Policy (Reminder)

It is very important that students submit work on time, or they will find it very difficult to keep up. All work in the course (e.g., self-study questions, reviews, homework/programming assignments, and exams) will be due by NOON or MIDNIGHT CT on the date noted on the class calendar. Assignments may be submitted up to four days late with a 25 points late penalty per day.  Students should reach out to their instructor immediately to discuss any concerns or to submit documentation of university-excused lateness.
