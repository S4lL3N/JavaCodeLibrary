M1: Summary
In Module 1, we learned about terminology used to design and analyze algorithms:

algorithm,
problem instance,
pseudocode,
time complexity,
space complexity,
input size,
best case,
average case,
worst case, and
correctness.

We expressed two simple algorithms using pseudocode: find-smallest(A) and Sort-Array(A). We analyzed their time and space complexities, but the correctness was not considered. Correctness is the topic we plan to cover for the next module. Module 2 will present formal elementary techniques to prove correctness. It will particularly focus on loop invariants.
