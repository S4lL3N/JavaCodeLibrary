About the Readings
Section 1.1 will introduce key terminology that you will need throughout this course. Read and pay attention to words in bold style. You can skim the topic "What kinds of problems are solved by algorithms" as you do not know precisely every problem. You can also skim the topic "Parallelism.

Section 1.2 will cover the important topic of efficiency. The objective of this course will mainly deal with the efficiency of the algorithms we will study. "Different algorithms devised to solve the same problem often differ dramatically in their efficiency" (from textbook). Efficiency is a paramount to this course.

Section 2.1 will cover the Insert Sort sorting algorithm and pseudocode. Skip the presentation and the analysis of Insert Sort and focus on the pseudocode conventions.

Consider While Reading
While reading, insure that you understand and learn the meaning of the new terminology and concepts.
