Welcome to CPSC 3273: Algorithms I

This course initiates you to understand, analyze, and design algorithms. You will learn how to design by analyzing well known algorithms that solve fundamental computational problems. An algorithm is good if it is correct and efficient. An algorithm is efficient if it runs fast and uses the least space. You will learn to determine and to characterize these three aspects (correctness, running time, and space) regardless of the programming language or the computer system used.


Course Outcomes
Upon successful completion of this course, you should be able to:

Read, write and understand algorithms,
Estimate the correctness and efficiency of an algorithm,
Implement and measure the efficiency of an algorithm, and
Learn algorithm design/modify/reuse techniques.
