* This program prompts the user to enter a character that represents a binary digit (a bit!). 
* Recall that a bit can be only 0 or 1. The program accepts a character as the input then outputs 
* the binary value of the character. If the character is not a bit the program informs the
* user that the character is not a bit and doesn't have a binary equivalent.
